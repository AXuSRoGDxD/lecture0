                         <p>
                           <ul>
<li>A Greyhound would actually beat a Cheetah in a long distance race! According to Psychology Today, Greyhounds are excellent long distance runners and can keep a speed of 35mph for up to 7 miles. Where the Cheetah is incredibly fast it can only keep its speed for around 200 -300 yards, so they may have the running start but it would soon be surpassed by a Greyhound!</li>
<h1></h1>
<li>According to PBS, a Bloodhound’s sense of smell is so spot on that it can be admitted as evidence in a court of law. Now if you thought that was an incredible dog fact, prepare to have your mind blown. Bloodhounds can also follow tracks that are over 300 hours old and can stay on a trail for over 130 miles! </li>

<li>Did you know that three dogs survived the sinking of the Titanic? Vetstreet states that the dogs were in first class and included a Pomeranian puppy - which her owner wrapped in a blanket to escape with, and everyone thought she was carrying a baby. Another Pomeranian and a Pekingese were also rescued. Move over Rose and Jack!</li>
<h1></h1>
<li>The African Hunting Dog is the most successful land hunter in the world. They’re successful in 50-70% of their hunts, which makes them consistently the best mammalian hunter, they even hold the current Guinness World Record for it.</li>

                         <ul>
                           <li>Leaving aside Tigers enormous body size, just look at their front-hands/legs, if you have a pet Tiger and a brutal enemy, you might as well send them for a fist fight. Kidding, you cannot have a pet tiger, it illegal! It is said that one swipe from a Tiger’s front hand is enough to kill a person or an animal, or at least break one’s bones.</li>
                           <h1></h1>
                           <li>The saddest part is that Tiger cubs are born blind and only a few survive. Literally, the newborn cubs can't see anything, they only follow the scent of their mother. Since they are born blind and can't keep up, most of them die of hunger or cold. Some even get eaten by male Tigers to make the Tigress available for mating. That’s just insane!</li>
                           <h1></h1>
                           <li>Perhaps, a good side of Tigers is that they have antiseptic saliva, so whenever you get a bruise and want to disinfect them, visit the doctor Tiger, just kidding! Usually what they do is, they tend to lick the area in order to prevent any infection.</li>
                           <h1></h1>
                           <li>Tigers tend to attack humans only when they feel threatened unless you look delicious (humour). But on a serious note, we cannot deny that fact, there have been reports on Tigers killing people in rural places, so it is best to stay away from their territory. If you come across such situations, it is best to walk backwards, constantly eyeing the Tiger, as mentioned earlier, as they mostly kill in ambush.</li>
                           <h1></h1>
                           <li>Unlike the domestic cats, its larger version enjoy spending time in the water and they love to swim for hours. Since cubs, female Tigers encourage or help learn the art of hunting, they even have the ability to kill in the water. And as adults, it is said that they can swim for several kilometres and even have reported one to swim for 30 km in just a day.</li>
